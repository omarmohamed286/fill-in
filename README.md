# Fill In — to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.
Knowledge gaps mean problems that you won't know how to solve in the future.  
Fill In helps you avoid future problems by identifying your knowledge gaps through a series of questions with explanations and external resources to help you learn what you don't know, ahead of time.  
The project is built in less than 10 days for a hackathon.
